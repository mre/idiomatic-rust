![Build Status - Check Links](https://github.com/mre/idiomatic-rust/workflows/Check%20Links/badge.svg)

This repository collects resources for writing clean, idiomatic Rust code. [Please bring your own.](https://github.com/mre/idiomatic-rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) :blush:

> *Idiomatic* coding means following the conventions of a given language. It is the most concise, convenient, and common way of accomplishing a task in that language, rather than forcing it to work in a way the author is familiar with from a different language. - Adapted from [Tim Mansfield](https://github.com/tim-hr/stuff/wiki/Idiomatic-coding)

* [An idiomatic way to sum up values in a multidimensional Array](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/an-idiomatic-way-to-sum-up-values-in-a-multidimensional-array/9485)

## üìú History

Coming from Python I loved to have some guidelines on how "idiomatic Python" looks like. I was inspired by the likes of Peter Norvig, who wrote amazing articles on [spellcheckers](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) and [sudoku solvers](https://norvig.com/sudoku.html).
And, of course, the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).

The goal of this project is to create a peer-reviewed collection of articles/talks/repos which teach idiomatic Rust style. It's a community project. If this becomes a thing I plan to move it to some "semi-official" place like rust-nursery or so. But first I need YOUR help for that ;-)
