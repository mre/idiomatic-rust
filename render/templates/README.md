This repository collects resources for writing clean, idiomatic Rust code. [Please bring your own.](https://github.com/mre/idiomatic-rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) :blush:

> *Idiomatic* coding means following the conventions of a given language. It is
> the most concise, convenient, and common way of accomplishing a task in that
> language, rather than forcing it to work in a way the author is familiar with
> from a different language. - Adapted from [Tim
> Mansfield](https://github.com/tim-hr/stuff/wiki/Idiomatic-coding)

## üìú History

Coming from Python, I loved the guidelines on how *idiomatic Python* looks like. I was inspired by the likes of Peter Norvig, who wrote amazing articles on [spellcheckers](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) and [sudoku solvers](https://norvig.com/sudoku.html); and, of course, the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). For Rust, there is no such thing as the Zen of Python, however, so I started collecting my own resources.
The goal of this project is to create a peer-reviewed collection of articles/talks/repos, which teach idiomatic Rust style. It's a community project and you can contribute.
